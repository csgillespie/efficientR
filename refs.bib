@article{Codd1979,
  abstract =     {During the last three or four years several investigators have
                  been exploring “semantic models” for formatted databases. The
                  intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of
                  the meaning of the data so that database design can become
                  more systematic and the database system itself can behave more
                  intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear: (I) the search for
                  meaningful units that are as small as possible--atomic
                  semantics; (2) the search for meaningful units that are larger
                  than the usual n-ary relation-molecular semantics. In this
                  paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support
                  certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions
                  represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in
                  semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for
                  insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic
                  operators.},

Many formats commonly used to import and export data between different programs or systems, such as CSV or JSON, are verbose, inefficient, not type-safe, or tied to a specific programming language. Protocol Buffers are a popular method of serializing structured data between applications  -  while remaining independent of programming languages or operating systems. They offer a unique combination of features, performance, and maturity that seems particularly well suited for data-driven applications and numerical computing. The RProtoBuf package provides a complete interface to Protocol Buffers from the R environment for statistical computing. This paper outlines the general class of data serialization requirements for statistical computing, describes the implementation of the RProtoBuf package, and illustrates its use with example applications in large-scale data collection pipelines and web services.},
