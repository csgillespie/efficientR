This practical book shows you how to bundle reusable R functions, sample data, and documentation together by applying author Hadley Wickham’s package development philosophy. In the process, you’ll work with devtools, roxygen, and testthat, a set of R packages that automate common development tasks. Devtools encapsulates best practices that Hadley has learned from years of working with this programming language.Ideal for developers, data scientists, and programmers with various backgrounds, this book starts you with the basics and shows you how to improve your package writing over time. You’ll learn to focus on what you want your package to do, rather than think about package structure.Learn about the most useful components of an R package, including vignettes and unit testsAutomate anything you can, taking advantage of the years of development experience embodied in devtoolsGet tips on good style, such as organizing functions into filesStreamline your development process with devtoolsLearn the best way to submit your package to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)Learn from a well-respected member of the R community who created 30 R packages, including ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr}, publisher={O’Reilly Media, Inc.}, author={Wickham, Hadley}, year={2015}, month={Mar}}

@article{Codd1979,
abstract = {During the last three or four years several investigators have been exploring “semantic models” for formatted databases. The intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of the meaning of the data so that database design can become more systematic and the database system itself can behave more intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear: (I) the search for meaningful units that are as small as possible--atomic semantics; (2) the search for meaningful units that are larger than the usual n-ary relation-molecular semantics. In this paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic operators.},
